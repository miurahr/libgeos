Package: libgeos-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libgeos-c1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}

Description: Geometry engine for GIS - Development files
 GEOS provides a spatial object model and fundamental geometric
 functions. It implements the geometry model defined in the
 OpenGIS Consortium Simple Features Specification for SQL. 
 .
 This package contains the headers and libraries needed to 
 develop programs using GEOS.

Description: Geometry engine for GIS - C++ development files
 GEOS provides a spatial object model and fundamental geometric
 functions. It implements the geometry model defined in the
 OpenGIS Consortium Simple Features Specification for SQL. 
 .
 This package contains the headers and libraries needed to 
 develop programs using GEOS in C++. Note that third-parties
 programs should use the stable C API instead of the 
 unstable C++ one.

Package: libgeos-c1
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Geometry engine for Geographic Information Systems - C Library
 GEOS provides a spatial object model and fundamental geometric
 functions. It implements the geometry model defined in the
 OpenGIS Consortium Simple Features Specification for SQL.
 Functions provided include:
 .
   * spatial predicates (based on the DE-9IM model),
   * overlay functions (intersection, difference, union,
     symmetric difference),
   * buffer,
   * convex hull,
   * area and distance functions, and
   * topological validity checking
 .
 This package contains the C library. A C++ library is provided
 by the libgeos-* package.
