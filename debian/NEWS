geos (3.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

   GEOS provides a (stable) C API and an unstable C++ one. Most programs use
   the stable interface. See http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/Applications for
   details. Starting from this version we are trying to short the list of
   reverse build-deps that require erroneously linking both C/C++ and binary
   NMUs frequency.

   A program which depends on the C++ API has to b-depend on the libgeos++-dev
   which in turn depends on the right libgeos-VERSION lib. All
   other programs have to b-depend on the C libgeos-dev package, which 
   depends strictly on the C stable interface (currently libgeos1).

   Note that geos-config has some problems on those regards, so current 
   version also provides the C lib only for --clibs, with the same approach
   adopted by upstream. See http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/497 about that.
